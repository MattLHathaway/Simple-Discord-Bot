# Simple-Discord-Bot
I built a simple Discord Bot in Python!  He notifies you when people join the server, how old he is, and typing "!shower" will cause him to share a random shower thought.
Make sure to go to the Application section of the Discord Developer site to get your bots specific ID code to apply it to your server.
